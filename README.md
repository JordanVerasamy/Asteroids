Asteroids

A simple Asteroids game that I made for a grade 12 computer science project, and ended up extending outside of class.

This is a modification to the classic Asteroids game, in which the player maneuvers a ship around to shoot asteroids and avoid getting shot.

Asteroids are randomly generated in pseudo-3D. When an asteroid is destroyed, it breaks apart into smaller asteroids, which have velocity dependent on the parent asteroid. The player has three distinct weapons - a shotgun-style blast, a high powered cannon, and a rapid-fire gatling. Between levels, the player can spend credits (earned by destroying asteroids) to upgrade individual stats on each weapon.

I mainly just liked this game because it was my first large project with relatively well-thought-out class heredity, and also the first large project I actually got to a demoable state. It's got really tight, responsive controls and is a real blast to play.

Usage

I haven't yet bothered packaging this and sticking the applet online somewhere. For now, if you want to run this, download it, open the project in your IDE, and run MainGame.java.
